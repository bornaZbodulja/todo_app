# ToDo List application
ToDo tasks list application made in Kotlin using the Architecture Components Room, ViewModel, and LiveData. When creating new task user has option for setting a reminder at certain day, and he receives notification at that day at 12 o'clock (notification only works when application is in background, still not sure why).
